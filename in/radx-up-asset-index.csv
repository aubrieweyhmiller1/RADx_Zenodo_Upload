First, we used structured sessions with RADx-UP partners to create causal maps that documented relationships between factors relevant to SDOH, a health-seeking behavior (COVID-19 testing), and community engagement strategies. Second, we searched, reviewed, and tied evidence from RADx-UP peer-reviewed literature to contextualize the causal maps. Results: We identified 17 unique pathways that linked SDOH to COVID-19 testing. The map also highlighted 3 mechanisms through which the community engagement addressed SDOH: (1) improving access to testing, (2) addressing health and digital literacy, and (3) conducting social needs screening and assistance.

To address the concerns, the CDCC leadership created the Long COVID CDEs Task Force (Task Force) to develop CDEs that would be added to the existing bank of RADx-UP CDEs. The Task Force comprised mainly of community partners and project personnel participated in various activities, including focus groups, to provide feedback on the fit for RADx-UP of CDEs created for the RECOVER program. What the Task Force process brought to light was the need to pivot away from the RECOVER CDEs and to create a novel set of CDEs that were a better fit for the populations served by RADx-UP.",4) Recommendation or guidance,PDF Document,N/A, https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaf046,Playbook (linked)
